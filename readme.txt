Syndicate Press is actively maintained and regularly updated with new features and enhancements. The Syndicate Press development team at <a href="http://henryranch.net/software/syndicate-press/">henryranch.net</a> has focused on ease of use, performance, stability and functionality to bring you a great plugin that will help keep your Wordpress site up to date with the latest in news feeds from every corner of the world.

v1.0.33: PHP 5.5 + Wordpress Mysql escape string fix, help updates, and license update
- Fixed an incompatibility issue with PHP 5.5 and Wordpress when using the mysql string escape methods
- Added a message in the support tab which indicates the PHP version of the server.  This should help with debugging.
- Updated the help tab with license, no warranty and credits headings
- Added a separate license file
- Added a notification in the RSS Feeds tab reminding site owners/admins/editors who use this plugin that some countries are now taxing for the republishing of syndicated content.  
  - The site owners/admins/editors who use this plugin are responsible to pay any fees or taxes arising out of their re-publishing of content from a feed.  

v1.0.32: Major update to support more robust feed downloads
- The feed download feature has been updated to support:
  - Redirects: will now follow (most) server redirects (the use of feed url redirects has grown recently)
  - SSL: will now download encrypted feeds (facebook, twitter, etc...)
    - In an effort to support as many feed publlishers as possible, Syndicate Press does not validate the authenticity of the SSL certificate, but rather accepts the certificate as provided by the feed url server. 
  - Cookies: now supports cookies when the feed server attempts to perform a redirect that requires cookies
  - The default feed download mode is still the same as 'download client' as prior versions
    - It is highly recommended that users update their download settings to use the new Curl download mode
    - In order to make use of the new features listed above, your php install must support Curl.

- The SP output can now be styled using CSS classes: USe the class 'sp-feed-item' to style the feed articles.  Use class 'sp-feeds' to style the entire feed content div.

1.0.20: New feature release<br>
Added a new short-code parameter, truncateTitleAtWord, which allows you to set a word, which, if detected in the title will truncate the title just prior to that word.  The result is that the word, and all words following it will not be shown on the page.  This is especially useful for affiliate rss feeds where product meta information is included in the article title, but is not actually important. Also updated docs on the help tab.

1.0.19: Bug fix release<br>
Fixed a bug in the length truncation code which would truncate the article or the article headline in the middle of a word.  With this fix, the article or headline will now be truncated on whole word boundaries, where a word is defined by any string of characters, separated by a space.  This change applies to the "Limit article to _____ characters" setting and the the "Limit article headline to _____ characters" setting on the "Display Settings" tab of the SP Admin panel.

1.0.18: New feature release<br>
Added a new short-code parameter, limitArticles, which allows you to override the global article limit for the short-code that the param is included in.  Use the new param as follows: [sp# feedList=feedName limitArticles=5].  Change 5 to whatever you want the max number of articles to be.

1.0.17: New feature release<br>
Added new SEO feature which allows the admin to add the rel=nofollow tag to the article links.

1.0.16: New feature release and bug fixes<br>
Added a new feature that allows the user to customize the format of the timestamp.<br>
Fixed a bug in the shortcode definition of the feednames to include in a page.  SP now allows the user to define the feeds to include as follows: feedList=feedname <br>
Updated the help tab with the new feedList example<br>
Added directory path display when the cache permissions are incorrect.<br>

1.0.15: Small performance update<br>
Removed an external server call which was slowing down the admin page load.<br>

1.0.14: Tiny bugfix release<br>
Fixed spelling error in Syndicate Press linkback text<br>

1.0.13: Documentation release<br>
Clarified some documentation around the file permissions check<br>

Added support for bbcodes in the text widget.<br>
Added a new check to make sure that the cache directories have the correct permissions.<br>
Updated some of the descriptions in the admin page to make them clearer.<br>

1.0.10: This is a bug-fix release.  Fixed the following issues: <br>
Failure to show feed items when "Show item description only when the viewer hovers over the item link." is selected.<br>
Error upon extra spaces and commas in the filter fields.<br>

1.0.9: Added the showImages parameter to the bbcode to enable display of feed images for all feeds included by that bbcode snippet.  i.e. [sp# feedname showImages=true]<br>

1.0.8: Added ability to define inclusive and exclusive filters within the bbcode i.e. [sp# feedname include=keyword exclude=keyword]<br>
Moved the custom formatting config out of the Display Options tab and into the new Custom Formatting tab<br>

1.0.7: Fixed an image display bug.  Placed the cache control buttons at the top of the admin UI.<br>

1.0.6: Major admin page UI refactoring to utilize tabs.  Tabs make managing the plugin much easier!<br>
Implemented first attempt at solving the go-daddy permanent redirect for rss feeds.<br>

1.0.5: Removed an extra line break after the article title and prior to the article timestamp.  <br>
Now the look of the title and timestamp is more controllable by the user.  The article title still defaults to a 
header2 level, but this can be removed in the plugin admin page.

1.0.4: Ignoring empty lines in the the feed url box.  <br>

1.0.3: Fixed a quote and slash escaping issue in the custom feed separator html and in the feed not found custom html.<br>

1.0.2: Added an article link to the '...' when an article is truncated by Syndicate Press.  Automatically replacing the feed:// protocol designator with http://<br>

1.0.1: Added an 'Update Settings' button to the top of the Admin Page.  Fixed a bug where a space between the | character and the feed URL (when using a custom feed name) resulted in the feed URL not being found.<br>
