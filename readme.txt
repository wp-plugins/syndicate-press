== Description ==

Syndicate Press lets you include RSS, RDF or Atom feeds directly in your Wordpress Posts, Pages, Widgets or anywhere in your theme. Syndicate Press features an easy to use admin page and includes great features such as feed caching, filters and numerous display options.

Unlike a number of other news syndication plugins for Wordpress, Syndicate Press does not force arbitrary formatting or CSS styling on the feed contents.  This allows the feed items to be displayed in your site like they are a fully integrated part of your content.

Syndicate Press is actively maintained and regularly updated with new features and enhancements. The Syndicate Press development team at <a href="http://henryranch.net/software/syndicate-press/">henryranch.net</a> has focused on ease of use, performance, stability and functionality to bring you a great plugin that will help keep your Wordpress site up to date with the latest in news feeds from every corner of the world.

Added support for bbcodes in the text widget.
Added a new check to make sure that the cache directories have the correct permissions.
Updated some of the descriptions in the admin page to make them clearer.

1.0.10: This is a bug-fix release.  Fixed the following issues: 
Failure to show feed items when "Show item description only when the viewer hovers over the item link." is selected.
Error upon extra spaces and commas in the filter fields.

1.0.9: Added the showImages parameter to the bbcode to enable display of feed images for all feeds included by that bbcode snippet.  i.e. [sp# feedname showImages=true]

1.0.8: Added ability to define inclusive and exclusive filters within the bbcode i.e. [sp# feedname include=keyword exclude=keyword]
Moved the custom formatting config out of the Display Options tab and into the new Custom Formatting tab

1.0.7: Fixed an image display bug.  Placed the cache control buttons at the top of the admin UI.

Implemented first attempt at solving the go-daddy permanent redirect for rss feeds.

1.0.5: Removed an extra line break after the article title and prior to the article timestamp.  
Now the look of the title and timestamp is more controllable by the user.  The article title still defaults to a
